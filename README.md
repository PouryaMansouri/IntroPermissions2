## Exploring the `permissions` Field in CustomGroup Model

In your `CustomGroup` model, you have defined three custom permissions: `change_user`, `view_user`, and `delete_user`. These permissions enable users in the group to update, view, and delete user profiles, respectively.

Here's a sample `CustomGroup` model that includes the `permissions` field:

```python
# models.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager, PermissionsMixin
from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, Permission

class CustomGroup(Group):
    permissions = models.ManyToManyField(Permission, verbose_name='permissions', blank=True)

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = 'Custom Group'
        verbose_name_plural = 'Custom Groups'
```

Now, let's see how to use the permissions defined in the `CustomGroup` model.

## Utilizing CustomGroup Permissions

First, you'll need to associate the custom group with one or more users using Django's built-in `Group` and `Permission` models. Then, you can use the permissions in your views and templates.

Here's an example of assigning the `CustomGroup` permissions to a user in a view:

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from myapp.models import CustomUser, CustomGroup

@login_required
def assign_group(request):
    user = request.user
    group = CustomGroup.objects.get(name='my_custom_group_name') # Replace with the name of your group
    permissions = group.permissions.all()
    user.groups.add(group)
    user.user_permissions.set(permissions)
    user.save()
    return render(request, 'assign_group.html')
```

In the example above, we have a view named `assign_group` that assigns the `my_custom_group_name` group to the logged-in user and sets the permissions defined in the group to the user.

We first retrieve the `CustomGroup` object with the specified name, then get all the permissions associated with the group. We then add the group to the user's group list using the `add` method and set the user's permissions using the `set` method. Finally, we save the user object to persist the changes.
